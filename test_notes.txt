1 - PMX is definitely better than xalt_edges(Shows more improvement in bigger datasets)
2 - Tournament selection (For both xover methods) is better than SUS by far
3 - Inversion mutation currently works best with all xovers, TODO : Explore when scramble is better than interchange
4 - PMX works best with both high xover and high mutation - xalt works best with low xover and high mutation. 
Both with tournament selection, this selection has the most impact!
5- Tournament selection converges much faster
6- PMX is much better with SUS compared to XALT
7- PMX also converges faster than XALT(Test without mutation)
8- The impact of PMX and Tournament can be better seen in larger datasets!
